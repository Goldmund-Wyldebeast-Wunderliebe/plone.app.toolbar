Toolbar Buttons
===============

Start with a Plone portal with collective.myrecentcontent installed.

    >>> app = layer['app']
    >>> portal = layer['portal']

Login as a user that would see the toolbar.

    >>> from plone.app import testing
    >>> testing.login(app, testing.SITE_OWNER_NAME)

Retrieve the list of buttons from an instance of the Toolbar class
used by the viewlet.

    >>> request = portal.REQUEST
    >>> request['ACTUAL_URL'] = portal.absolute_url()

    >>> from plone.app.toolbar import toolbar
    >>> tb = toolbar.Toolbar(portal, request)
    >>> buttons = tb.buttons()

The folder contents action is first.

    >>> buttons[0]['url']
    'http://nohost/plone/folder_contents'
